# Interactive Food Search and RAG Chatbot System 🍽️🤖

## Overview
This project is an advanced **food recommendation and conversational AI system** built using **Chroma DB** and Python. It demonstrates three distinct approaches to similarity search and AI-driven interaction using a rich food dataset that includes nutritional data, ingredients, cooking methods, and taste profiles.

The system showcases real-world applications of **vector databases**, **similarity search**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** through fully interactive command-line interfaces (CLI).

## Key Features

### 🔍 Interactive CLI Food Search
- Real-time food search that responds instantly to user queries
- Uses vector similarity search for accurate and relevant recommendations
- Designed as a user-friendly command-line interface with interactive loops

### 🧠 Advanced Search Filtering
- Combines similarity search with metadata-based filtering
- Supports constraints such as:
  - Cuisine type
  - Calorie limits
  - Ingredient inclusion or exclusion
- Demonstrates how to build precise and powerful search systems

### 💬 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot
- Intelligent chatbot that blends:
  - Vector similarity search
  - Context-aware natural language responses
- Provides conversational food recommendations
- Demonstrates modern AI-powered search interfaces

### 🏗️ System Architecture Comparison
This project implements **three different approaches** to solving the same problem:
1. Basic similarity search
2. Similarity search with advanced filtering
3. Conversational RAG-based chatbot

This allows direct comparison of trade-offs between traditional search and AI-enhanced systems.
